Rock - paper - scissors game with HTML, CSS and JS.

I would say it was a bit challenging but still better than what I expected, I had some problems in the beginning trying to figure out how to change each immage of the
hands because of the function callback but I figured out what I had to do after all.

Main points I had to focus on:

I.   how to randomly select items out of an array

II.  how to make elements inherit css properties

III. a bit of jQuery syntax

IV.  DOM manipulation

V.  proper use of the setTimeout() function in JS
